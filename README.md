# admin-dashboard

This is my solution for the admin dashboard project from The Odin Project coding curriculum. The object of this project was to build an admin dashboard based on a mockup design that was provided.

This project helped me develop and hone my CSS skills as the majority of the project was focused on layout. I made heavy use of CSS grid to organize all the elements, which was great practice as I tend to not make use of the feature often enough. Since a lot of CSS would have to be written, I found this project to be a great opportunity to work with SCSS and Webpack. I used SCSS in conjuction with the BEM (block, element, modifier) front-end naming convention to help me organize my styles, which I then compiled using a Webpack loader. I played around with the Webpack config file and used dev server to do live reloads of the page while I changed the layout and styles. I would say the most challenging part of this project was working with the Webpack config file but this was a fantastic introduction to the bundler.
